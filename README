INSTRUCTIONS

This is still in development at the moment (but I hope to have it finished in time for Christmas!).

This is a Google App Engine (Python) project. It's really just HTML - nothing dynamic (but I may as well use GAE as it's easy and free.)

Simply view the index.html in your browser, or...

To run up GAE:

  dev_appserver.py .

To deploy to GAE:

  appcfg.py update .

FEATURES

 - Open web standards (HTML5 <canvas> & <audio>, CSS3 transitions, fonts) - works on many devices (e.g. iPad)
 - Optimised for touch-based devices (tap & swiping)
 - Offline caching
 - No images used, anywhere (except for one tiny exception - the snowflake)

--

STILL TO DO

 Must haves:
 - Check whether font will cause a prompt each time (try on another computer)
 - Fix centering horizontally

 Should haves:
 - Fix swiping on iPhone - only seems to work one in three or so (not so much of an issue since adding tap support)
 - Fix so whole height is shown on iPhone in landscape orientation - or allow pinch to zoom out and stop it making the whole thing go crazy...
 - Set initial music volume to be lower? Add volume control?
 - Change the music to something better?
 - Refactoring, tidying...

 Nice to haves:
 - Use the real Telegraph font for 'The Telegraph'?
 - Something extra on inner page - an animation? Swinging bell?
 - Support more browsers, e.g. Firefox 4 (but there's no 3D transform support yet)
