Christmas Card for my Telegraph colleagues 2010

INSTRUCTIONS

This is in the early stages of development at the moment (but I hope to have it finished in time for Christmas!).

This is a Google App Engine (Python) project. It's really just HTML - nothing dynamic (but I may as well use GAE as it's easy and free.)

Simply view the index.html in your browser, or...

To run up GAE:

  dev_appserver.py christmascard2010/

To deploy to GAE:

  appcfg.py update christmascard2010/

STILL TO DO

 - Fix bug whereby if you go left/right too fast it goes weird
 - Offline capability - manifest file
 - Do the quick-win styling fixes for Firefox (prob won't be able to get page flipping though)
 - Use the real Telegraph font for 'The Telegraph'? (Maybe copyright issues?)
 - Something extra on inner page - an animation?
 - Refactoring, tidying...
 - What happens when the music stops...?
