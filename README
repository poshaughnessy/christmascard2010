COMPATIBILITY

This card has been built for WEBKIT browsers

 - Google Chrome - fully working
 - Safari - fully working
 - iPad 4.2 - fully working (but no snowflakes as it's too slow at animating them so I disabled it)
 - iPhone 4.2 - fully working (but no snowflakes and you can't see the whole card in landscape orientation)
 - iPad/iPhone pre-4.2 - no Tangerine font (doesn't support TTF fonts)
 - Firefox 3.6 - displays initial view OK, but card won't open (no 3D CSS transition support)

INSTRUCTIONS

This is still in development at the moment (but I hope to have it finished in time for Christmas!).

This is a Google App Engine (Python) project. It's actually all client-side - nothing requires any server-side code (but I may as well use GAE as it's easy and free.)

Simply view the index.html in your browser, or...

To run up GAE:

  dev_appserver.py .

To deploy to GAE:

  appcfg.py update .

FEATURES

 - Open web standards (HTML5 <canvas> & <audio>, CSS3 transitions, fonts) - works on many devices (e.g. iPad)
 - Optimised for touch devices (tap & swiping)
 - 'Web app capable' - add to home screen on iPhone/iPad for full-screen view
 - HTML5 offline caching - works offline
 - No images used, anywhere (oh ok, except for two tiny exceptions - the snowflake PNG, and the iOS home screen icon)

STILL TO DO

 Must haves:
 - REMOVE DEFAULT_EXPIRATION FROM app.yaml
 - PUT BACK CACHE.MANIFEST DECLARATION in index.html

 Should haves:
 - Use the real Telegraph font for 'The Telegraph'? Or try a better font, at least?
 - Fix Tangerine font for iPhone/iPad pre 4.2 - I thought the SVG version should work? Or I could go back to using Google Font API and forget about that font working offline?
 - Fix swiping on iPhone - only seems to work one in three or so (not so much of an issue since adding tap support)
 - Fix so whole height is shown on iPhone in landscape orientation - or allow pinch to zoom out and stop it making the whole thing go crazy...
 - Change the music to something better?
 - Refactoring, tidying...

 Nice to haves:
 - Set initial music volume to be lower? Add volume control?
 - Something extra on inner page - an animation? Swinging bell?
 - Support more browsers, e.g. Firefox 4 (but there's no 3D transform support yet)
