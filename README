INSTRUCTIONS

This is in the early stages of development at the moment (but I hope to have it finished in time for Christmas!).

This is a Google App Engine (Python) project. It's really just HTML - nothing dynamic (but I may as well use GAE as it's easy and free.)

Simply view the index.html in your browser, or...

To run up GAE:

  dev_appserver.py .

To deploy to GAE:

  appcfg.py update .

FEATURES

 - Open web standards (HTML5 <canvas> & <audio>, CSS3 transitions) - works on many devices (e.g. iPad)
 - Optimised for touch-based devices (tap & swiping)
 - Offline caching
 - Google Font API (Tangerine font)
 - No images used, anywhere (to reduce bandwidth)

STILL TO DO

 Must haves:
 - Offline capability - manifest file - STARTED, NEED TO TEST
 - Fix so whole height is shown on iPhone in landscape orientation - STARTED
 - Do the quick-win styling fixes for Firefox (prob won't be able to get page flipping though) - STARTED
 - Switch enabled buttons when the music stops - STARTED
 - Fix swiping on iPhone - only seems to work one in three or so
 - Change the music to something decent

 Should haves:
 - Set initial music volume to be lower? Add volume control?
 - Refactoring, tidying...

 Nice to haves:
 - Use the real Telegraph font for 'The Telegraph'? (Maybe copyright issues?)
 - Something extra on inner page - an animation?
